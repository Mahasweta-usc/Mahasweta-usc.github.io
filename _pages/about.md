Hello and Welcome!

I am a doctoral candidate in Computational Social Science and organizational communication at the Department of Communication, UC Davis. I conduct empirical policy research in emerging technolgies, informed by a background in applied and theoretical deep learning. I am advised by [Prof. Seth Frey](https://communication.ucdavis.edu/people/seth-frey) and part of the [Computational Communication Research Lab](https://c2.ucdavis.edu/). I have a Masters and a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California and Jadavpur University.


My interests concern collectivism and self-governance among autonomous, online communities producing digital public goods (DPG). I study decentralized Open Source software (OSS) projects to understand how they establish consensus, cooperate and ensure productivity. This involves modeling policies analytically, detecting how they are constituted and observed within developer teams, and finally assesing their effective impact on the project's growth and sustained operations. 

I am presently foraying into how OSS regulates the scope of application and rights over AI artifacts/products they create, with rising general purpose usage and associated risk concerns. 

Tracking governance evolution over project documentation, emails, issues and other unstructured, historcial trace data requires extensive information retrieval and extraction. While furthering economic and sociological frameworks for OSS research at scale, I have acquired significant experience with deep NLP stacks to develop and enhance an array of linguistic and semantic methods. I have particularly worked in leveraging language models for discursive, behavioral constructs, and low resource representation learning and domain adaptation from limited expert annotation. 

I am currently supported by the National Science Foundation under the Growing Convergence Research (GCR) Scheme. I am also a regular summer speaker at the [Institutional Grammar Research Initiative](https://institutionalgrammar.org/).

My work extensively incorporates information retrieval and extraction over large repositories of unstructured data through deep learning and NLP stacks. Over the course of my research, I have acquired experience in an array of linguistic and semantic methods, leveraging language models for qualitative behavioral and sociological constructs, and low resource representation learning from limited domain expert annotation.  -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
